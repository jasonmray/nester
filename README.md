# Building the Nester NES emulator in 2016

This repo should build cleanly with Visual Studio 2015 and run fine on Windows 10.

The first commit is just a copy of the last Nester codebase from 2002(?) labeled "nester public beta 4"

The first commit was taken directly from the source archive on Zophar's domain:
  + http://www.zophar.net/nes/nester.html
  + Name: Source v2002.02.02
  + MD5: fdfa80577fb0c67972496b592034a9d3
  + SHA1: 857b4dc505c0b3a74eeba8e4f4094f920adad90b


Later commits are conservative changes to get things to work.




I've found the nester codebase is a relatively small, simple codebase good for hacking on 
if you're reverse-engineering games or just trying to learn more about NES hardware.
